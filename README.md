Project Overview

Youtube dataset explains the statistics of the most subscribed YouTube channels.

Hypotheses:

1. The creation of YouTube channels is more prevalent in countries with higher unemployment rates.

2. Channels with higher uploads have faster subscriber growth.

3. Videos with higher video views also have higher subscriber counts.

Conclusions:

1. Not necessary that channel uploads are higher if unemployment rate is higher

2. Channels with higher uploads don't have faster subscriber growth

3. Videos with higher video views also have higher subscriber counts

Business Implications:

Valuation Metrics: Using view and subscriber growth metrics to assess the potential value and growth trajectory of YouTube as a platform.

Market Trends: Analyzing trends in video consumption to make informed investment decisions in digital media and entertainment sectors.
